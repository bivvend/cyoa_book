As they traverse the glistening cobblestones, Elara senses a subtle distortion in the Veil, heightening her awareness of their surroundings. Suddenly, the air thickens, and the shadows seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy. A shadowy figure emerges from the mist, its presence exuding a palpable sense of malice. For a fleeting moment, the figure's eyes glow with an ember-like intensity reminiscent of Malakar's influence before it vanishes into the darkness. This encounter not only unsettles the party but also serves as the first tangible hint of Malakar’s pervasive reach within the plaza.",
