The air is thick with tension, and the shadows seem to whisper warnings, echoing the cryptic passages Elara deciphered from the Tome. Consulting these ancient texts, the party gains crucial insights into the horrors that await them, setting a foreboding atmosphere. As they step into the tower's Entrance Hall, the flickering runes and oppressive silence amplify their unease. Suddenly, Veilbound Horrors emerge from the shadows, launching an unexpected ambush.
