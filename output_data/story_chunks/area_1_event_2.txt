As the Twilight Vanguard made their way through the mist-cloaked streets, a sense of anticipation hung heavy in the air. Elara led, her instincts sharpening as she guided her companions toward the celebrated Fountain of Echoes. Shadows danced along the cobblestones, and the distant sound of water splashing provided a rhythmic counterpoint to the stillness surrounding them. With every step, the atmosphere thickened, as if the very stones held secrets yearning to be unveiled.

The fountain soon came into view, its ancient stonework glistening under the dim light. At its edge stood Eldrin the Historian, a figure both ethereal and grounded. His tattered robes swayed with the cool wind, while wild silver hair framed his face, each strand seemingly charged with the energy of his many years spent safeguarding knowledge. As they approached, his eyes glinted with an intelligent spark, welcoming yet burdened by the weight of untold stories.

“Ah, the Twilight Vanguard! How fitting that you should arrive now,” Eldrin declared, motioning for them to gather closer. His voice held a warmth that contrasted with the chilly air, but there was an underlying urgency that caught Elara's attention. “Eldenfall vibrates with your presence, and it is no mere coincidence that you have found your way here. I possess fragments of tales that may serve you well.”

“What can you tell us about the shadows we encountered?” Thalia inquired, her curiosity intertwining with trepidation. “They felt… alive.”

Eldrin’s gaze turned solemn, the light in his eyes dimming as he spoke. “Ah, those spectral remnants harbor a long-lost history that whispers of the Order of the Shattered Star. This ancient faction was tasked with guarding the secrets buried beneath this very plaza. Their duty was weighty—truths that could either save us or hold us in eternal darkness.”

Korr folded his arms across his broad chest, leaning closer, intrigued. “What kinds of truths? And why are they buried? Is it fear that cloaks them?”

The historian nodded gravely. “Fear, yes, and also protection. Knowledge can be a double-edged sword. The Order believed these truths, if misused, could spell disaster. But many tales they guarded have faded, left for the brave to uncover.”

Elara felt the gravity of Eldrin's words resonate within her, circular patterns of fate beginning to intertwine. “What must we do to access this knowledge?” she asked, her determination flaring.

“To earn the secrets, you must first prove yourselves.” Eldrin’s tone brightened slightly, a playful glint returning to his eye. “Answer my riddles. They will test your intellect and bravery.”

“Bring it on,” Mirela replied boldly, stepping forward with a hint of defiance. 

Eldrin stroked his chin thoughtfully. “Here is the first: ‘I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?’”

The air grew still, the echoes of the fountain dimming as silence dipped around them. The group exchanged glances, their minds whirring. Elara could feel tension coursing through her companions. Thalia’s brow furrowed in concentration before her eyes widened. “An echo!” she exclaimed. 

“Very astute!” Eldrin responded, his expression lighting up with approval. The air tingled around them, an arcane energy surging through the fountain’s waters, making them shimmer. “You have proven yourselves worthy to progress.”

Glancing at her companions, Elara felt the bond of determination tightening between them. This was more than a trial; it was an intersection of their fates.

As Eldrin continued sharing tales of whispered secrets hidden in the depths of this very plaza, Elara’s mind buzzed with questions. The mention of the Order of the Shattered Star and their ancient duty offered a glimpse into a world that resonated with danger and allure. She was reminded of the heaviness of the previous encounter—the shadows lurking just out of sight, reminding them of the stakes at play.

“More riddles, then?” Korr prodded, and his eagerness reverberated through their group, igniting a fire in their collective spirits.

“Yes, indeed,” Eldrin replied, his voice steady. “Each trial shall bring you closer to understanding what binds this place together. But heed my words: the truth can be both liberating and ensnaring.”

A charged silence fell upon the Vanguard as the rhythmic pulse of the fountain echoed their heartbeat—their journey had just begun, and they stood on the precipice of revelation【4:0†source】.
