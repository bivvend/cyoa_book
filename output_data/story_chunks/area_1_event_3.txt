As the echoes of Eldrin's tales reverberated through the humid air of the Whispering Plaza, a sudden rustle disrupted the fervent energy around the Fountain of Echoes. The darkened corners of the plaza betrayed movement, and from the shadows emerged a motley group of Rubble Rats, their gaunt forms hunching as they scavenged near the fountain's edge. The faint light glinted off their tattered rags, revealing faces etched with weariness and suspicion. Their eyes flickered toward the Twilight Vanguard, a palpable tension coating the air like the lingering mist.

Korr Stonefist instinctively stepped forward, a gentle rumble in his deep voice, steady yet inviting. He held his immense hands open, palms up, baked in the grit of the plaza's cobblestones. "We mean you no harm," he declared, his brow furrowing slightly. "We seek knowledge, not conflict. What brings you to this place of whispers?" The question carried a weight of sincerity, both to quell fears and to bridge the growing divide.

The leader of the Rubble Rats, wiry and shrewd, stood tall despite his scrappy appearance. He jerked his head sharply at Korr, narrowing his eyes like a hawk assessing its next move. "Knowledge, you say? You tread on dangerous ground, stone-giant," he replied, his gravelly voice roughened by suspicion. “The Veil cult's been stirring up shadows, creeping like smoke in the wind. They've touched things that should lie undisturbed, rallying restless spirits with their tampering.”

Korr's chest tightened in alarm, the seriousness of the implications setting an edge to his features. "The Veil Cult? What do you know of their doings here?" He leaned slightly closer, his towering presence softened by genuine concern.

The Rubble Rat exchanged furtive glances with his companions, their faces shifting in the flickering shadows cast by the fountain’s light. He lowered his voice, urgency coloring his words. "Whispers speak of old alters defiled, secrets awoken from their slumber. In this chaos, alliances are as fragile as glass." He hesitated, weighing his next words carefully. "If you seek safe passage, a toll may be required—a piece of knowledge for the light you carry against the shadows."

Korr felt a flicker of intrigue as he considered the proposal. "What kind of knowledge?" His diplomacy skills sharpened, as he sensed the moment was precarious yet ripe with potential.

"Follow the shadows to find what was stolen from the heart of the temple," the Rat replied cryptically, his gaze darting to the obscured corners of the plaza. The tension in his voice hinted at something deeper lurking behind his words. “But heed my caution—the Veil's eyes are everywhere, and they see more than you imagine.”

A sense of gravity settled over Korr as he nodded slowly, recognizing the thread of danger weaved into the very air around them. "We shall heed your warning. Safe passage in return for the truth—agreed." The murmurs among the Rubble Rats hushed, their initial apprehension beginning to dissipate, but the air remained charged, a silent acknowledgment of the delicate truce established.

As they prepared to part ways, Korr turned back, his eyes sharp with curiosity. “And what do you seek from us, little ones?”

“Just remember us if the times grow darker, stone giant,” the leader uttered, allowing a hint of a mischievous grin to surface. “In these shadows, we survive by the light of our wits.” 

With a shared look of cautious optimism among the Vanguard, Korr felt a surge of confidence. They were building bridges where others might see walls. As the last vestiges of the Rubble Rats’ figures merged into the shadows, Elara’s voice cut through the lingering silence. “Insight can be found in the unlikeliest of places,” she noted softly, her fingers brushing against the cool, damp stone of the fountain.

Korr smirked, understanding the truth of her words as they reverberated through him. They had merely scratched the surface of understanding in this mystical plaza, with echoes of secrets yet to unfold amidst the gathering gloom【4:0†source】.
