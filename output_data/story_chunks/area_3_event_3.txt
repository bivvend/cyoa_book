As Korr continued his exploration of the Grand Hall of Tomes, a sudden chill crept through the air, skimming his skin like a whistle through a hallowed wind. He turned, drawn by a familiar presence at the doorway—Thalia Mirefoot. Shadows danced around her, intertwining with the faint glow of lanterns, illuminating the unease etched on her face.

“Thalia!” Korr called softly, his voice almost swallowed by the vast stillness. But she raised a hand, silencing him with a single, deliberate gesture. Her intense gaze remained fixed on the shadows, as if perceiving something beyond the ordinary.

“The Veil stirs,” she whispered, her voice tremoring like the flickering light around them, laden with urgency. The Totem of the Ancestors hung from her neck, radiating an ethereal glow that seemed to pulse in response to the restless atmosphere. Korr watched as she stepped closer to one of the lanterns, the light illuminating beads of sweat on her brow.

Thalia closed her eyes, fingers brushing the totem. “Spirits of the past,” she began, her voice quavering yet resolute, “I seek your wisdom. What omens lie within these stones? What whispers linger in the Veil?”

The air shimmered, twisting as if the very fabric of reality was being tugged at by unseen hands. Korr shuffled closer, drawn in by her invocation. Shadows swirled at the periphery of his vision, his pulse quickening. “Thalia,” he urged, a knot of anxiety tightening in his chest, “what do you see?”

She exhaled sharply, her breath catching as she frowned. “Malakar’s influence grows like an insidious fog. His shadows seek to meld with our world… we cannot afford to overlook this.” Her eyes shot open, haunted and wide, the wisdom of countless ancestors reflected in her gaze. 

“An echo—a storm is coming,” Korr remarked, his voice low, terrified of the weight behind her words.

Thalia nodded, her resolve momentarily faltering. “The whispers… they speak in riddles, warnings buried in layers of pain.” A flicker of fear crossed her face. “And the lanterns… look how they flicker in response to the Veil. It's as if they feel the disturbance.”

“Do you think they mark boundaries we shouldn’t cross?” Korr asked, glancing around, feeling an overwhelming sense of dread.

“It’s possible,” Thalia responded, her brow furrowing as she scanned the restless shadows. “Or they may be acting as sentinels. We must tread carefully—every step feels like we’re on the brink of revealing something we can’t take back.”

As they exchanged glances, Korr’s heart raced, the air thickening with anticipation around them. The Hall felt alive, its ancient stonework holding secrets that were desperate to remain hidden. “What should we do, Thalia?” he asked, stepping closer, intent on grounding themselves in this eerie atmosphere. 

Thalia’s grip tightened on the totem, her fingers trembling slightly. “We need to uncover what lies beneath this place. The answers are rooted within these stones, but the cost of finding them… it may be more than we are willing to bear.” Her voice, though steely, trembled with an undercurrent of doubt.

Fragmented whispers echoed faintly, reverberating off the crumbling walls, urging both of them to listen. Korr felt a chill in his bones. “They’re trying to warn us, aren’t they?” he whispered, a spinal dread coursing through him.

“Yes,” Thalia replied, eyes closed once more as she sought connection. Shadows flickered around her, teasing the edges of comprehension. “But their cryptic insights leave me uneasy… Vigils grow restless, we should be wary.”

Korr could sense the tension rising between them like a coiling storm. “I’ll stand by you—whatever darkness we face, we’ll face it together,” he vowed, not as a warrior but as an anchor.

“Together,” Thalia reiterated quietly, though uncertainty clouded her gaze. “But first, I must listen. I must understand.” 

As they braced themselves against the ripple of tension, a shadow flickered just beyond the doorway, an unsettling reminder of the threats lurking nearby. The air thickened, pressing against their chests as they prepared to delve deeper into the hall’s depths, the weight of impending revelation settling over them. In that moment, the two of them stood at the precipice of truth, shrouded in the whispers of the past, aching to discover what lay hidden in the shadows—yet all too aware of the dangers it might bring.
