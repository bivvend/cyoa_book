The shadow that darted between the trees took form, coalescing into the ominous shape of a Wraith of Eldar. Its ethereal presence seemed to suck the warmth and color from the surroundings, cloaking everything in a shroud of despair. Thalion tensed, instincts honed from years of combat urging him to protect his comrades as the wraith's hollow eyes fixated on them.

“Hold firm!” Eldrin called, determined to stand his ground. He felt the weight of his companions behind him, their resolve steadying him even as the Wraith threatened to engulf them in despair...

“Now, let’s find a way to turn this back against it...”
