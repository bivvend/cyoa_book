The struggle against the Wraith of Eldar turned into a realization of the precarious moment they stood in. With Eldrin channeling the shield's energy, Thalion’s keen senses swept over the surroundings, searching desperately for a pathway out. He caught Eldrin's eye, urgency flashing within him.

“We can’t stay here,” Thalion urged, his voice low but intense. “If we don’t move, we risk summoning more wraiths.” 

“I can hold it for a bit longer!” Eldrin grunted, forcing back the energy of the wraith. 

“Let’s regroup and make haste while we can!” Gimble added, peering nervously into the thickening shadows. 

“Follow me!” Thalion commanded, already moving with determined confidence. He focused on the vestiges of tracks and hints in the foliage that indicated a way they had not yet explored—an escape route hidden amid the chaos.

“Stay close, we don’t want to get separated!” Thalion reminded them as he led the charge, cutting through the eerie silence and steering the group towards safer ground. 

The air crackled with residual energy from the wraith, shadows danced at the periphery of Thalion’s vision, a reminder that the threat still loomed behind them. 

Eldrin felt the pressure of the dark force behind him, but he concentrated on Thalion’s voice guiding them. “Just a little further!” 

As they rounded the corner of an ancient oak, Thalion scanned for any signs of danger, breath catching as he spotted a flicker of light ahead. “This way! I can sense it’s safe up ahead!” 

Gimble traded glances with Eldrin, both filled with hope and trepidation. “We should go before it gets any worse. I don’t like the stillness…” 

Just moments away from their escape, a root caught underfoot, and Thalion stumbled but regained his composure quickly. “Keep moving! The wraith isn’t far behind!” He urged, adrenaline igniting their flight.

As their safe haven loomed closer, the wraith’s shriek echoed from the depths behind them, a chilling sound that urged them onward. They burst through the underbrush and into a small clearing, where the morning light broke through the trees, bathing them in warmth and hope. 

“Almost there…” Thalion gasped, navigating by instinct and the remnants of nature around them...
