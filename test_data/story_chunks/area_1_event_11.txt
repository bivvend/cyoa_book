Realizing the immediate peril they faced, the Echoing Vanguard wasted no time in formulating an escape plan. The lingering presence of the Wraith of Eldar stirred uneasily as a sense of urgency enveloped the trio like the thick fog that often cloaked the glade.

"Eldrin, I can sense more of them gathering! We need to move!" Thalion urged, scanning the periphery as wisps of shadow began to emerge from the shadows, growing bolder with every passing moment.

"We can’t stay here," Gimble nodded in agreement while drawing a quick breath, the adrenaline surging through him. "Thalion, your tracking skills are our best chance to find a way out."

With a determined look, Thalion squinted into the depths of the trees. "Follow me and keep close! I remember the path from when we passed through here," he declared, his voice carrying a note of urgency.

As they began to retreat, Eldrin took a final glance at the wraith standing defiantly in the clearing. "Let’s move. We cannot allow this chaos to attract more of its kind," he warned, already feeling the dark energy pushing against his shield.

Gimble hurried after Thalion, fervently trying to clear the clamor of panic flooding his mind. "If we all channel the light we felt earlier, perhaps it can guide us!"

Eldrin growled low under his breath, fatigue creeping into his bones, yet he understood their goal. "We rely on your instincts, Thalion! Stay focused."

As they navigated the underbrush, the shadows swayed ominously, but Thalion’s keen perception ensured they made swift progress. The terrain, though treacherous, became an ally in their flight, and each step felt more assured as he led them away from the wraith's dark call.

"Eldrin! Keep your shield raised! We need any advantage we can muster," Gimble called, glancing back at their spectral pursuer.

"And keep your wits about you," Eldrin replied, mindful of the whispers that threatened on the borders of their sight. "The wraith isn’t the only danger here."

Moments later, Thalion halted abruptly, gesturing urgently toward a narrow gap concealed by overhanging branches. "There! We can slip through there. Quickly!" He held aside the branches, allowing the others to pass through into the hidden passage that veered away, cradling them in its protective embrace.

Breathless yet relieved, they moved as one through the narrow escape route, the wraith’s ominous howls fading behind them. Once they felt secure in a small clearing beyond the darkened trees, Thalion turned to the group. "We did it. We’re safe from that wraith for now."

"It seems chaos only begets more chaos," Eldrin remarked thoughtfully, glancing back into the shadows. "But we remain united."

"Indeed!" Gimble said energetically, "And together we can find a way to turn this moment to our advantage!" 

The party now moved cautiously, their spirits lifted by the successful evasion, with a shared sense of purpose leading them forward into the uncertain woods.
