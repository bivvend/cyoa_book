As they stepped into the depths of the grove, the atmosphere shifted, thickening around them like a palpable mist. The enchanting beauty of the Serene Pool became an unsettling backdrop; its waters shimmered as if concealing darkness beneath. The air grew still, the rustling leaves falling silent in anticipation. 

Thalion felt a chill dance down his spine as he caught sight of the Pool’s reflection swirling sinisterly, and then, abruptly, it was as if the world around them began to distort.
