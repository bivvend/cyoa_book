Eldrin chuckled softly, “Or a warning. Let’s avoid immersing ourselves too deeply in curiosity. We should assess and gather before diving into the unknown.”

The echoes mingled with their thoughts, revealing hints of ancient knowings. As they ventured deeper, the shadows seemed to reply, whispering secrets yet to be spoken...
