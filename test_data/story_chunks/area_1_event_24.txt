The air in The Echoing Glade underwent a palpable transformation as the party pressed on. The vibrant flora seemed to vibrate with life, blending the sounds of rustling leaves and soft, melodic whispers of ancient knowledge. The Eldritch Relic pulsed gently in Thalion's hand, resonating with the rhythm of the glade, as if it were eager to share its secrets.

“Let’s proceed towards the Stone of Whispers,” Thalion suggested, his voice firm. “We can channel the relic’s power there and seek the knowledge it can provide about Krythar’s past and how we may confront its present menace.”

As they ventured deeper into the glade, a sudden breeze intertwined their ambitions with an urgency, electrifying the air around them. It felt as if the very glade listened, poised to reveal the truths lying hidden in its depths, waiting for their next move....
