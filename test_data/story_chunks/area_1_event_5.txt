With a sudden ripple, the waters of the Serene Pool began to churn, distorting the surface like a veil being torn away. Thalion and Eldrin took a step back, their senses alert to the impending drama unfolding before them. From the depths emerged shadowy figures, coalescing in the air, their forms both familiar and haunting.
