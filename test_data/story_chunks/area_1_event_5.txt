As the Echoing Vanguard settled down near the serene waters, the tranquil atmosphere took a sudden turn. Just as Gimble continued to study the ancient tablet, the waters of the Serene Pool began to ripple ominously. The once calm surface darkened, stirring memories best left undisturbed.

Eldrin stood up, a frown etching his features. "What is happening?" he inquired, scanning the area for danger.

Without warning, figures began to emerge from the depths of the pool—transparent, gliding forms that hovered just above the water's surface. They took shape as the Phantom Watchers: apparitions of those lost to Krythar's despair, their expressions a haunting amalgamation of sorrow and rage.

Thalion Moonshadow stepped forward, instinctively reaching towards the encroaching shadows. “These souls… they’ve suffered greatly,” he murmured, feeling a deep connection to their plight. “We must not let their despair drag us down.”

The Phantom Watchers swirled around the party, their voices a discordant choir echoing chilling pleas. "Help us! Free us from the chains of despair!" They grasped at the air, their translucent limbs reaching out, trying to find solace in the living.

Eldrin tightened his grip on his shield, an unyielding barrier against the overwhelming sorrow. "Stay strong! They are but echoes of despair!" he urged, yet his voice trembled ever so slightly.

Thalion closed his eyes, focusing on the gentle whisper of the wind rustling through the trees surrounding the glade. With every deep breath, he drew upon the essence of nature that anchored him. "These are illusions," he declared with newfound determination. “They cannot harm us; we must hold to the light within us!” 

As the Phantom Watchers advanced, attempting to pull the party into their eerie waltz of lament, Thalion opened his eyes. The connection with nature illuminated his vision—a radiant pathway unfurling amidst the haze of despair. “Follow me! Trust in the bond we share with the Vale!” he commanded, leading them away from the phantom grip.

Eldrin nodded, gaining confidence from Thalion’s strength. “We can’t let Krythar win by trapping us in sorrow!”

Side by side, the party followed Thalion, navigating through the swirling shadows as the Phantom Watchers' wails echoed behind them. “We are here to fight, not to fade away!” Thalion’s voice rang clear, guiding them toward safety.

The illusion began to falter as they ventured forward, the air freshening with each step they took away from the mists of despair. Thalion’s connection to nature became their beacon, illuminating the path ahead and freeing them from the phantoms that sought to ensnare their hearts  .
