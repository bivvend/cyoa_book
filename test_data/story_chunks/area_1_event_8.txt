With Elysia's warning fresh in their minds, the Echoing Vanguard set forth into the depths of the woods, the urgency of stealth weighing upon them. Thalion Moonshadow, the group's ever-watchful ranger, took the lead. Shadows darted between the trees, and the underbrush whispered secrets of the lurking dangers—the Shadow Beasts that Elysia had spoken of.

As the party moved forward, Thalion slowed his pace, his keen senses heightened, sensing the oppressive atmosphere thickening around them. "Stay close and quiet," he instructed, casting a glance back at Eldrin and Gimble. "We must slip by without being noticed."

Gimble’s eyes sparkled in the dim light, but the apprehension was evident. "What if they can smell us?" he whispered. His voice barely broke the eerie silence.

"Then we must mask our presence," Thalion replied, confidence threading through his tone. "Focus on your breathing, let the forest guide you." 

Their journey through the woods took on a haunting stillness, each rustle of leaves and snap of twigs resonating like thunder in their ears. The muscles in Thalion’s legs quivered in anticipation, and as they approached a particularly dense thicket, he gestured for them to halt.

“Look there,” he pointed. Just ahead, a pair of Shadow Beasts prowled, their forms barely discernible against the darkened foliage. They moved with predatory grace, sniffing the air, searching for any hint of trespassers.

Thalion inhaled sharply, desperate to quell the tension climbing within him. “We can bypass them if we remain still and silent. Move only when they turn away.”

Eldrin nodded, his steel resolve matching Thalion’s, while Gimble struggled to mask his nervousness. “This is nothing like the stories. What if—I mean, can we really evade them?”

“Trust in the Vale and each other,” Thalion reassured, his voice steady. “If we work together, we can make it through.” 

With a shared glance, the three of them synchronized their movements, following Thalion’s example. They crept forward, hearts pounding as the beasts became a blur to their sights. Inch by inch, they threaded through the underbrush, the sway of branches above joining them in a spell of camouflage.

At last, they slipped past the beasts without incident, a lingering sigh of relief intermingling with the silence of the woods. Thalion raised a hand, signaling for them to halt once more once they were far enough away.

"Eldrin, Gimble, we made it," he whispered, a hint of disbelief coloring his words. 

Gimble grinned, his nervous energy abated by the thrill of their narrow escape. "We did, didn’t we? I thought we were goners for sure!"

Eldrin smiled, his tone lightening, “We just need to stick together. The Vale protects those who tread with care.”

The woods whispered around them, a tender reminder that they had prevailed—if only momentarily. Together, united in spirit and purpose, they plunged deeper into the heart of the forest, ever vigilant against the shadows that still lurked close by.
