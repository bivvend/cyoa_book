With a shared resolve, Thalion, Eldrin, and Gimble prepared to move through the woods, each step heavy with the weight of Elysia's warning. The soft glow from the orbs of light twinkled reassuringly against the encroaching darkness, weaving a path for them to follow. Thalion took the lead, instincts sharpened, aware of every crackle of twigs and rustle of leaves that might betray their presence to the lurking Shadow Beasts.

“Keep low and stay close,” he whispered, glancing back at his companions. Eldrin nodded, adjusting his grip on his shield while Gimble, filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, eagerly followed behind them. 

As they moved deeper into the shadowy embrace of the woods, the air thickened with tension, and the sensation of unseen eyes peering from the underbrush heightened. Thalion’s breaths came steady and deep, grounding himself in the moment. “Remember our goal,” he reminded them, “we are stronger together. Stay quiet and focused.”

Suddenly, from the depths of the trees, a low growl reverberated, sending a ripple of tension through the group. Eldrin stiffened. “Do you think they can sense us?” he murmured, a hint of worry in his voice.

“Not if we stay calm,” Thalion replied, scanning ahead to locate the glimmers of light guiding them. “Trust in the shadows; they hide more than they reveal.” 

As they navigated through the thick underbrush, the soft whispers of old trees seemed to echo their fears, telling tales of those who had strayed into Krythar's territory before. Yet, just as doubt began to creep in, Gimble broke the silence, his voice soft yet clear, “If we can reach the clearing up ahead, we might have a better vantage point. The ancient runes could also provide clues about Krythar's minions.”

“A good thought, Gimble,” Thalion affirmed, feeling the camaraderie surge between them. The urgency of their mission fueled their progress, each step carefully taken. 

And so, they pressed on, guided by the ephemeral lights dancing before them. The eerie quiet was punctuated only by their cautious movements and the muffled sounds of their breaths. With every moment, the presence of the Shadow Beasts loomed closer, but Thalion ensured they slipped past undetected, his instincts leading them like a thread through the dark tapestry of the woods, until at last they reached the designated clearing and paused to catch their breath...
