As the three companions caught their breath in the clearing, a flicker of interest sparked in Gimble's eyes. “Look at these markings!” he exclaimed, stepping closer to an ancient tree whose gnarled bark had been etched with a series of intricate runes. The soft glow from the surrounding orbs of light revealed the symbols shimmering faintly in the dimness of the woods.

Eldrin leaned in beside him, squinting at the ancient lettering. “Do you think they’re connected to Krythar?” he asked, his voice a mix of intrigue and caution.

Thalion, still alert for any signs of danger, nodded slightly. “It’s possible. The trees here have been touched by time, perhaps they hold the secrets we need.” 

Gimble knelt down, tracing his fingers gently over the carvings. The symbols seemed to respond, pulsing with warmth under his touch. “These runes… they don’t just tell stories. They could be clues about Krythar’s weaknesses!”

“What do you mean?” Thalion asked, his eyes narrowing as he remembered Elysia’s warning about the dark entity stalking the woods. 

As Gimble deciphered the markings, his brow furrowed in concentration. After a moment, he straightened, excitement lighting up his face. “I think I’ve found something! It suggests that light can weaken Krythar’s powers! If we can harness light in some way, it could give us an advantage in our confrontation.” 

“Light?” Eldrin echoed, glancing at their surroundings where shadows were creeping with the fading dusk. “That could be crucial information. We have an ancient stone tablet—perhaps it can help us channel this light.”

Thalion’s expression shifted as he weighed their newfound knowledge. “Let’s make sure to stay vigilant. There’s no telling what else lurks in these woods, or if Krythar has already noticed our presence.”

As they gathered closer, Gimble continued to study the runes, determined to unlock more secrets hidden within the ancient carvings. Just then, Thalion heard a rustling sound nearby, making his heart quicken. “Did you hear that?” he whispered sharply, his instincts flaring. 

Gimble nodded, eyes wide with apprehension. “We should prepare for—”

But before he could finish, a shadow darted between the trees, and the tranquility of their discovery shattered as they braced themselves for whatever might emerge from the gloom...
