Stepping further into The Echoing Glade, the atmosphere thickened with whispers swirling around the party. The vibrant flora, alive with colors and sounds, seemed to pulse in harmony with the gentle breeze, inviting and enigmatic. The Eldritch Relic in Thalion's grasp thrummed softly, resonating with the rhythmic ebb and flow of the glade's energy.

Eldrin frowned, “Or the spirits might tell us tales that are better left untold. We should maintain our focus on the Stone of Whispers. It may hold the key to understanding Krythar’s dark influence.”

The echoes within the glade responded to their discussion, a gentle swell of ancient voices harmonizing in an unseen chorus, sending shivers down their spines. They exchanged glances, recognizing both the beauty and the peril surrounding them as the weight of their quest hung heavily in the air, compelling them deeper into the glade's embrace...
