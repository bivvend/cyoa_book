Suddenly, the vibration deepened, and the Stone of Whispers resonated more intensely, filling the glade with a palpable energy. Eldrin and Thalion exchanged glances, their hearts synchronized with a mix of anticipation and trepidation. The time had come to make a decision—should they channel the energy of the Eldritch Relic into the stone?
