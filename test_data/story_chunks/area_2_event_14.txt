With the air thickening around them, Eldrin and Thalion felt an instinctive draw towards the hidden passage unveiled by the echoes of the Stone of Whispers. The silhouette of the path seemed to beckon them, shrouded in mystery yet undeniably connected to Krythar's essence. 

“Look,” Thalion pointed, his voice steady despite the weight of their discoveries. “The passage leads deeper into the glade; we need to uncover what lies ahead.”

Eldrin felt a shiver run down his spine, not from fear, but from the knowledge of what they were facing. “We must tread carefully. There’s no telling how strong Krythar's influence is in that direction.”

As they approached the entrance of the passage, the whispers of the glade grew louder, swirling with a tone of urgency and foreboding. “These whispers carry warnings, I can feel it,” Thalion mused, his brow furrowing. “It’s as if the very spirits of the forest are trying to guide us—or perhaps keep us away.”

“Gimble would have loved to see this,” Eldrin replied, their absent companion’s insight rippling through his thoughts. “He would have deciphered the riddles of the shadows in moments.” 

“But he’s not here,” Thalion reminded gently. “We carry the knowledge he left with us, and we must use it. Besides, we have the Eldritch Relic; perhaps it can shield us from whatever lies beyond.”

They shared a brief yet determined glance, silently agreeing to press on. The passage promised further revelations, perhaps even answers to the darkness threatening their home. With a deep breath, they stepped forward, the shadows flickering at the edges of their vision.

“Let’s find out what this passage has to tell us about Krythar…”
