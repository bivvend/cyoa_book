As they pressed deeper into the shadows, the air suddenly shifted, charged with a malevolence that swept over them like a cold wave. A growl reverberated from the darkness, sending a chill down Eldrin's spine.

“Thalion, be ready,” Eldrin warned, gripping the Eldritch Relic tightly. His heart raced as he scanned their surroundings, acutely aware of the encroaching danger.

“What is it?” Thalion whispered, shifting his stance to draw an arrow from his quiver. 

Before they could prepare themselves further, a pack of Shadow Beasts erupted from the underbrush, their eyes glowing with a sinister hunger. The creatures snarled, sharp claws glinting in the scant light filtered through the shadows.

“Get back!” Thalion shouted, releasing an arrow that soared through the air, striking one of the beasts squarely in the shoulder. It howled in pain, but there were too many closing in.

Eldrin focused, positioning his shield forward. “We need to stand our ground. We can't let them overwhelm us!” He felt the power of the Eldritch Relic radiate through him, enhancing his resolve.

“Then let’s show them we’re not afraid,” Thalion replied, his voice steeling with determination. As the beasts lunged, Eldrin swung his shield to deflect an incoming attack while Thalion fired another arrow, finding its mark in the muzzle of a beast advancing from the flank.

The fight was fierce as they battled the creatures, using every skill they possessed. “Stay close!” Eldrin called out as he swung his sword, slicing through the darkness that surrounded them. Each movement was calculated, teaming up to fend off the relentless Shadow Beasts.

With each growl and screech, the air thickened with the scent of fur and rage. Thalion’s arrows flew true, but the beasts kept coming, their shadows blending seamlessly into the dim light around them. 

Eldrin panted as he faced down another beast, adrenaline coursing through him. “This isn’t just about us. We have to protect each other…”
