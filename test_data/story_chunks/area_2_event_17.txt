The battle with the Shadow Beasts escalated as their terrifying forms blended completely into the darkness surrounding Eldrin and Thalion. Each moment tested their resolve, their breath coming quick and shallow as they fought to maintain their ground against the relentless tide of glowing eyes and sharp claws.

“Stay focused! Aim for the legs!” Eldrin shouted, his voice steady despite the chaos around them. He thrust his shield forward, blocking the snapping jaws of a beast just inches away from his face.

“I can’t cover every angle!” Thalion replied, nocking another arrow with urgency as he scanned the area. “We need to push through! There’s too many of them!”

Just then, a beast lunged from the shadows, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. Eldrin managed a quick sidestep, the beast crashing into the ground where he had stood moments before. Thalion took his chance, releasing an arrow that struck true, hitting the creature in its flank. It howled, but the call only seemed to draw more of the beasts towards them.

As they continued to fight, Eldrin felt a surge of energy from the Eldritch Relic at his side. “Thalion! We must use the relic’s power!” he declared, a plan forming in his mind. “If we can channel its energy, we could turn the tide!”

“Just tell me how!” Thalion grunted, grappling with a beast trying to claw its way past Eldrin’s shield.

“Focus on me!” Eldrin instructed, stepping back to create space between them and the creatures. “I’ll create a barrier—hold them off just a bit longer.”

The intensity of the fight surged as Thalion held firm against two beasts, twisting and dodging their attacks while aiming for any weakness he could target. “You better move quickly, Eldrin! I can’t keep this up!”

Gathering his determination, Eldrin concentrated on the relic, feeling its ancient power resonate within him, trying to weave it into a protective shield. “Channeling the energy—it’s holding! Once I release it, we’ll unleash a barrier that could..." 

But before he could finish his thought, the ground trembled beneath them, and a low sound echoed through the glade—the arrival of more beasts, ready to join the fray as shadows converged around them. “Thalion, brace yourself...!”
