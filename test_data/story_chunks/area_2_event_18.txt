The tremors of the ground faded, but the shadows continued to swirl around Eldrin and Thalion, a reminder of the danger they had just faced. Although the beasts had been vanquished, an unsettling silence enveloped the glade, broken only by the distant rustle of leaves. As they caught their breath, a glimmer caught Thalion’s eye.
