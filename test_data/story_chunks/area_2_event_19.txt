As Gimble's fingers danced over the glowing runes, each stroke of his hand sent ripples of energy through the air. The pulsing light grew more intense, revealing complex symbols that sang of ancient truths. Finally, Gimble's eyes widened in realization.

“I've got it!” he exclaimed, startling Eldrin and Thalion from their thoughts. “These runes... they can bind Krythar. But we need to speak its true name aloud at the Stone of Whispers!”
