The moment hung in the air, thick with anticipation, when suddenly the ground beneath them trembled violently. A cacophony of ethereal wails erupted as Maddened Spirits began swirling around the party, drawn inexorably to the power of the Eldritch Relic. The thrumming energy of the relic felt almost charged, and it pulsed in Thalion's grip as if echoing the spirits' frantic energy.

"Eldrin! We need to stand together!" Thalion shouted, bracing himself against the increasing pressure of the spirits that whipped through the glade like a violent storm.

Eldrin responded, his voice firm amid the chaos, “We can’t let them break us. Focus on the relic; it’s the light that can push them back!” 

Suddenly, it felt as though the forest itself was alive with the frenzied energy of the spirits, their whispers twisting into a maddening chorus. It was a haunting blend of sorrow and rage, a lament for what might have been, echoing through the glade. 

Gimble, eyes wide with excitement, shouted above the din, “Maybe they can actually help us! We could understand Krythar's grip on this realm if only we could communicate—”

“Focus, Gimble!” Thalion snapped back, feeling the weight of responsibility bearing down. “We cannot risk it. We defend ourselves first, then we listen!” 

Drawing from their combined strength, Thalion and Eldrin positioned themselves back to back, thrusting the Eldritch Relic forward. Glimmers of light spilled from it, clashing against the dark, swirling masses of spirit energy. The relic hummed louder now, resonating with a power neither had expected. The spirits pressed in, their forms flickering in and out of sight, their voices rising into a tumultuous roar.

With a sudden surge of determination, Eldrin called out, “Together, now! Push back!”

The two men, united in purpose, raised their weapons—Thalion with his blade, Eldrin wielding his shield. Channeling their will into the Eldritch Relic, they felt the energy surge as the light of the relic formed a protective barrier around them. The assembled spirits collided with the light, their howls turning into a symphony of despair and confusion. But even amidst the chaos, Thalion felt a glimmer of hope spark within him...

How long they could hold back the swarm remained uncertain...
