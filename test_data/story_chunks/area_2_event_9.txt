The wraith lunged forward, its translucent form charging at Eldrin and Thalion, hatred palpable in its shriek. Dark tendrils extended from its figure, seeking to entwine the hearts and souls of the two adventurers, threatening to drain their life force. 

“Stay together! Do not let it isolate us!” Thalion shouted, nocking an arrow to his bow with fierce determination.

Eldrin gripped his shield tighter, ready to absorb the incoming attack. “Thalion, focus on its movements! I will hold it off as long as I can!”

As the wraith closed in, its chilling breath washed over them like icy water, nearly severing their resolve. With a swift motion, Eldrin raised his shield, deflecting a wave of dark energy that recoiled off the Eldritch Relic embedded in the stone. 

“Together!” Eldrin bellowed, channeling their shared strength. “On three! One… Two… Three!” 

Thalion unleashed his arrow, striking true. The wraith wailed in agony, the arrow disrupted the shadows it commanded, sending tremors of light cascading through the darkness. 

“Great shot!” Eldrin encouraged, pushing back against the wraith’s surge. “Keep pressing on—end it now!”

The wraith recoiled, shuddering as Thalion fired another arrow, this time laced with a flickering light that erupted upon impact. “I’ve got this! Let’s push it back!” 

With every shot, Thalion’s arrows disrupted the dark essence of the wraith while Eldrin held the line, drawing strength from the bond that united them. The air around them crackled with energy, and the Stone of Whispers hummed resonantly in response to their efforts.

“Keep it steady, my friend,” Eldrin encouraged through gritted teeth, momentarily gasping from the effort. “It is weakening!”

“Together, remember? We will not falter!” Thalion replied, his voice steady, focusing all his energy into another shot.

Bit by bit, they forced the wraith back, its cries growing faint as it struggled against the light invading its darkness. Finally, with one last combined effort, the wraith released a shriek of despair as it retreated, tumbling into the shadows from whence it came.

“Did we do it?” Eldrin panted, lowering his shield and gazing into the depths of the darkness, half-expecting the wraith to leap back at them.

“We did!” Thalion said, eyes shining with a mix of relief and triumph. “But we need to stay vigilant. More will come if we give them the chance.”

The Stone of Whispers pulsed gently, seemingly grateful for their victory, as they steadied themselves against the stone's ancient power...
