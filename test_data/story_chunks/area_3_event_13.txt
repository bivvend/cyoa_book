Gimble’s heart raced as he wandered further into the Arcane Library, his fingers brushing against the well-worn tomes. The thrill of discovery ignited his imagination. “There has to be something here that will tell us how to combat Krythar!” he declared, his voice echoing softly in the vast chamber.

He began his search, scanning the scrolls with increasing urgency. His eyes darted from title to title, each one whispering promises of forgotten knowledge. Gimble muttered under his breath, “If only I could find a reference to the dark magic running through this spire…”
