As the air around them thickened with the weight of forgotten shadows, Gimble's heart raced with a newfound urgency. He reexamined the scroll, his brow furrowing in concentration. “Eldrin,” he called, pushing the musty pages aside, “there’s more here! It speaks of a hidden chamber deep within the spire—one that might hold the key we need to confront Krythar.”

Eldrin stepped closer, intrigued. “A hidden chamber? Could it be the source of the dark magic we’ve felt throughout this place?” His voice carried a mix of hope and caution.

“Exactly!” Gimble exclaimed, his excitement bubbling over. “It could reveal secrets about the dark rituals Krythar employed—a way to counter its influence, perhaps even unearth the very magic we require for our battle.”

Thalion, still leaning against the shelves, raised an eyebrow, a smirk creeping across his face. “And here I thought you’d never find anything worth mentioning. Shall we find this hidden chamber, or do you prefer to stay here reading dusty tomes?”

Gimble shot him a playful glare. “Less jesting, Thalion! This is crucial. We must follow this lead.” He turned, determination etched upon his features. “We can’t ignore the possibility that this chamber holds answers to Krythar's betrayal! It might provide us the insight we desperately need.”

Eldrin nodded gravely, “Then we should move quickly. The shadows are restless, and we cannot let Krythar’s magic linger much longer.” 

Without another word, the trio gathered their resolve and ventured deeper into the Arcane Library, believing in the whisperings of the scroll. As they moved through the labyrinth of shelves and scrolls, the air seemed to darken, and faint whispers echoed like distant warnings.

“Did you hear that?” Eldrin asked, pausing to look around. The unsettling whispers seeped into their thoughts, raising the hairs on the back of their necks.

Gimble nodded. “We must be wary. There’s a presence here that wishes to deter us…”

They pressed on, hearts pounding in unison, knowing that the hidden chamber awaited, mysterious and potentially perilous, a beacon of hope in the encroaching darkness...
