The spectral sentinel surged forward, its form fluctuating chaotically between shadow and light. Eldrin stood firm, brandishing his sword as he shouted, "Gimble! Hold your ground!"

Gimble glanced at Eldrin, still feeling the weight of the moment pressing on him. "I’ll set a trap! If we can predict its movements, we might catch it by surprise!" He began to scurry around, eyes keen for any advantage, while Eldrin assumed a protective stance.
