As they stepped beyond the threshold of the spire, an unsettling crackle surged through the air, vibrating against their very skin. Each member of the party felt it—the unseen tension that thickened with every breath, as if Krythar's dark gaze was already upon them, peering through the veil of reality.

"It feels like he's waiting for us," Thalion said, squaring his shoulders against the oppressive atmosphere, glancing back into the shadows of the spire. "We need to move quickly before he seizes the moment."

Eldrin, his brow furrowed, nodded in agreement. "Let us not linger here. Every second wasted is a chance for Krythar to tighten his grip."

Gimble, trembling with a mix of anxiety and excitement, added, "Together, we can push through! Just remember how the light can disperse the shadows." His words, though filled with optimism, could not completely mask the underlying fear that tinged their voices.

As they ventured deeper into the glade, the environment transformed with each step—the once-familiar path now felt treacherous, overgrown with twisted roots and haunting whispers that seemed to beckon them towards despair. Shadows danced along the edges of their vision, flickering in an unsettling rhythm, a reminder that they were not alone.

Gimble turned towards Thalion, a determined gleam igniting in his eyes. "I think we should channel the energy of the Ancient Seal as we reach the boundaries of the Grove. It might amplify our strength against Krythar."

"Good idea. But we must be wary," Thalion replied, his instincts sharp. "If we channel too much energy too early, it could alert Krythar to our approach."

“Then let’s prepare ourselves now—gather your resolve,” Eldrin said firmly, gripping the Eldritch Relic at his side. “Krythar might be lurking just out of sight, ready to strike.”

With senses heightened, the trio pressed on through the thickening gloom, the air now thick and heavy, almost choking with dread. Each crunch of their boots against the ground echoed louder, amplifying their fears within the silence. The path seemed to stretch endlessly, time elongating as they fought the pull of the darkness wrapping around them like a great shroud.

In unison, they clutched their items closer—a collective reminder of their purpose and the hope they still held. Yet beneath that hope, a dreadful knowledge simmered: they were far from safe, and time was not their ally. As they traversed the shadows, the whispers intensified, murmuring one word over and over, a single name that hung in the air like a tolling bell...

Krythar...
