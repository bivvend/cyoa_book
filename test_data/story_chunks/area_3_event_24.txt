With the clarity of connection still lingering in their hearts, the party set forth into the twilight. The sun dipped beyond the horizon, casting long shadows that stretched like fingers across the Vale. The distinct shift in the air felt alive with anticipation, tempering the resolve they had kindled together.

Eldrin led the way, urging them onward toward the ominous Abyssal Grove. "Stay close, everyone. The path ahead may become treacherous," he cautioned, the weight of their mission pressing heavily upon him.

Thalion walked beside him, his determination mirrored in the set of his jaw. "We’ve faced darkness before. Together, we can confront whatever Krythar has in store.
