As Eldrin, Thalion, and Gimble, pressed onward through the corridors, a sudden chill swept over them, more potent than before. The shadows appeared to stretch menacingly, coiling around their feet as they navigated the darkened passages of The Shattered Spire.

“Do it, Gimble!” Eldrin encouraged, confidence blooming as they trusted in their companion's ingenuity.

With careful precision, Gimble reached into his pack for the Eldritch Relic, holding it aloft as an arcane light streamed forth, enveloping the runes. “Just stay behind me!” he instructed, and with cautious steps, they navigated a path illuminated by the protective energy.

As they moved forward, a growing sense of relief washed over them, each step bolstered by the power of the relic. They were nearly through, the cursed runes fading behind them when suddenly…

A faint, disquieting whisper echoed from the shadows, warning them to tread lightly...
