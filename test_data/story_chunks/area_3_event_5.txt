As the whispers faded into an unsettling silence, the trio proceeded forward, their senses heightened by the ominous presence that surrounded them. They ventured deeper into the dimly lit corridors of The Shattered Spire, where the shadows danced wildly along the stone walls, creating curious shapes that seemed to beckon them closer.

In the heart of a small chamber, the dim glow of a distant light momentarily pierced the gloom, revealing a hidden alcove. The air thickened with an unsettling energy, prickling their skin like the static of a thunderstorm. Gimble’s heart raced as he approached, drawn by an unseen force.
