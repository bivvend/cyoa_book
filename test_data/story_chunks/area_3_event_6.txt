As the weight of the moment pressed upon them, the air in the small chamber shifted. With a sudden, chilling breeze, shadows surged forward, coalescing into the forms of Wraiths of Eldar. Their spectral bodies writhed in distress, drawn to the pulsing energy of the Tome of Eldritch Knowledge. Whispers, haunting and raw with intent, filled the air, pleading for the tome to be relinquished.

“Thalion! Eldrin!” Gimble shouted, scrambling back from the tome, fear gripping his heart as the wraiths closed in. “We need to brace ourselves!”

Thalion quickly nocked an arrow, his expression hardening. “They guard the secrets of this place. We cannot let them take the tome!”
