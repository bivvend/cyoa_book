It stood in stark contrast to the green around it, carved from dark stone and flanked by offerings that dripped with despair—dried flowers, brittle bones, and withered fruit, all exuding a heavy malaise that hung in the air.

Gimble Tinkertop, stepping cautiously closer, studied the inscriptions etched into the altar's surface, feeling an unsettling pulse from the dark energy radiating off it. "This must be what Krythar has left as a mark of its grip on this grove," he muttered, awe mingling with dread in his voice.
