As the light expanded and began to push back against the suffocating shadows, a sudden clarity struck Gimble like a bolt of inspiration amidst the chaos. "Wait, the Ancient Seal of Binding!" he exclaimed, his eyes widening as he clutched the shard tightly. "If we activate it with the shard, we can weaken Krythar!" 

"Eldrin, Thalion!" he called out, urgency lacing his voice. "Think about it! The seal is meant to bind creatures like Krythar. If we combine its power with this shard... it could give us a fighting chance!"

Thalion insisted, taking a step closer to Gimble and Eldrin, determination setting his features. "Let’s do this then—if we are to face Krythar, we need to unite our efforts!"

"Right, we will have to move in coordination," Gimble clarified, his voice steady. "On my count, we channel the power of the shard into the seal. Are you ready?"

As they braced themselves for the ritual, the surrounding darkness loomed ominously, the serpentine form of Krythar shifting dangerously in the gloom, waiting for its moment to strike...
