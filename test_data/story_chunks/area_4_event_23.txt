The vibrant light pulsed in waves, washing over the grove as the last remnants of Krythar’s dark power retreated. "Now," Thalion called, determination blazing in his eyes, "we must finish what we've started!" With coordinated resolve, the trio surged forward, channeling their energies through the Shard of Krythar's Essence, united in purpose.

Eldrin lifted the shard high, feeling its warmth resonate with his heart. "We won't falter now!" he shouted, the echoes of his voice merging with the brilliant luminescence surrounding them. Together, they could sense Krythar's veiled form writhe in desperation, the serpent's strength ebbing as their combined magic surged.

"Let’s amplify our powers!" Gimble exclaimed, his voice alive with excitement. “If we channel the Eldritch Relic with the shard, we could drive Krythar into the shadows!” 

They formed a circle, hands raised, uniting their intentions. Soft whispers of hope flickered in the air, feeding their resolve. A surge of radiant energy filled the center of their gathering, creating a beacon of light so pure that it momentarily pierced the shadows surrounding them. Eldrin glanced at his companions, sharing a nod of solidarity.

As they invoked the final binding incantation, they felt the tension around them snap. The light knotted with shadows, spiraling tighter around Krythar. "This ends today!" Thalion yelled, his voice cutting through the cacophony of despair.

"But we can!" Thalion retorted, determination steeling his voice. "Light always overcomes darkness!" 

With one final push of energy, they unleashed the combined force of their magic toward Krythar, a blinding flash cascading outward. The darkness howled in agony, splintering apart like glass under a hammer, each shard of shadow dissolving into the ether.

Yet even in its moment of defeat, Krythar lashed out, summoning dark tendrils that writhed like serpents. "I will not be bound! You will pay for your insolence!" it hissed, echoing its threats with haunting malice that coiled around their hearts...
