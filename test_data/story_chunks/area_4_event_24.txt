As Krythar's dark tendrils vanished into the ether, a stillness enveloped the grove, the vibrant light they had summoned illuminating every inch of the once-cursed land. The air felt purer, the oppressive weight of despair beginning to lift from the hearts of the three companions. Eldrin looked around, breathing deeply as the familiar sounds of nature began to filter back into existence—a gentle rustling of leaves, the soft chirping of birds returning to their perches.

Eldrin’s expression turned thoughtful, contemplating all they had faced. "Whatever the future holds, I know we will face it together..."
