The surge of Shadow Beasts descended upon them, their dark forms flowing like liquid night through the underbrush, snarling and snapping at the air. Thalion quickly assessed the encroaching pack, his heart racing as he positioned himself behind Eldrin's sturdy shield. "Focus on your breathing, Eldrin," he murmured, drawing another arrow into his bow. 

"I'll form a line," Eldrin grunted, his steadfast presence a bulwark against the onslaught. He thrust his shield forward, bracing for impact. Just then, a beast lunged toward Thalion, its claws glistening with menace. 

"Not today!" Thalion shouted, letting his arrow fly. It struck true, embedding itself in the creature's flank, causing it to howl in surprise. The beast faltered, the sound reverberating with an unsettling echo through the trees.

Despite the urgency of the moment, a voice broke through the chaos: "We can’t let them surround us! Aim for their throats! They are weak there!" It was Gimble, pointing out the vital spots in the fray. The battle raged on, the energy between them intensifying with each unleashed strike, each instinctive maneuver resonating with the strengthening bond forged in the heat of combat...
